# Molecular Tumor Board Alliance (MTBA)

In this module, the genetic data to import is stored in a directory (/tmp/bridgehead/mtba/input). A process checks
regularly if there are files in the directory. The files are pseudonomized when the IDAT is provided. The files are
combined with clinical data of the blaze and imported in cBioPortal. On the other hand, this files are also imported in
Blaze.
